# Introduction 

**CellsPickMe** is a comprehensive R package for cell type proportion prediction based on DNA methylation data. As cell identity is crucially linked to cell function and DNA methylation profile, estimation of cell type proportion is instrumental to understanding major factors driving DNA methylation variability. Accounting for inter-individual cellular heterogeneity is also vital in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to accurately evaluate the signals associated with the variables of interest. 

The main purpose of the RAMEN package is to conduct a methylome-wide analysis to identify which model (G, E, G+E or GxE) better explains the variability across the genome. In this vignette, we will illustrate how to use the package. 

```{r modelstable, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)

models = data.frame(Tissue = c("Peripheral blood", "Cord blood", "Saliva", "Brain"),
                    Reference_dataset = c("Reinius (2012)", "IDOL (2016)", "IDOL extended (2022)", "Mixed", "Cord (2018)", "Middleton (2022)", "Brain (2012)")) 

kable(models, caption = 'Available Tissues')
```

The **CellsPickMe** package takes DNA methylation data generated from Illumina microarray and predict its cellular composition based on cell types available in the reference profiles. Currently, the algorithm is compatible for peripheral blood, cord blood, saliva, and brain (neuron vs non-neuron).

# Cell type proportion estimation

In addition to improved methods for feature selection to optimize prediction process, the package also includes several features to assess prediction accuracy.

The **CellsPickMe** package includes 5 core functions: 

-   `getRef()` finds and load the tissue-specific reference data set
-   `combData()`combines the reference and the user's sample data sets together
-   `pickProbes()` picks features that best distinguish cell types (multiple feature selection methods available)
-   `clusterScore()` assesses the performance of selected features in clustering cell types in the reference
-   `predictCT()` estimate cell type proportions based on selected probes, with the ability to evaluate 

The `pickProbes()` function can be computationally intensive, depending on the methods for feature selection. Parallel computing is available and highly recommended for improved efficiency. Detailed usage is available [here][Step by step guide]

The following data are required for performing the cell type proportion prediction with **CellsPickMe**:
- DNAme data (RGChannelSet Object is recommended, beta matrix is accepted as well)
* An appropriate reference can be obtained with the `getRef()` function. Otherwise the user can specify their own reference dataset as well (needs to be a RGChannelSet Object with CellTypes information in the pData)
